## Project Overview

Plantsy is a React-based web application that interacts with a backend API to manage plant data. The app allows users to:

- View all plants.
- Add new plants.
- Mark plants as sold out.
- Search for plants by name.
- Update the price of plants.
- Delete plants.

The application is built using **React** for the frontend and a JSON server to handle backend data.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/Njijinoela/react-hooks-cc-plantshop.git>
cd react-hooks-cc-plantshop
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the JSON Server

Start the JSON server to handle backend API requests. The server will run on `http://localhost:6001`.

```bash
npm run server
```

This will run the backend server on port `6001`. You can visit `http://localhost:6001/plants` to verify the backend is working.

### 4. Start the React App

In a new terminal window, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the app on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 5. Open the App

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the app.

## Features

### Core Features

1. **View All Plants**: When the app starts, all plants are loaded from the backend and displayed.
2. **Add a New Plant**: Users can add new plants to the inventory using the provided form. The plant will be immediately added to the list and saved to the backend.
3. **Mark as Sold Out**: Users can toggle the availability of each plant. If a plant is in stock, it will be marked "In Stock", otherwise, "Out of Stock."
4. **Search for Plants**: Users can search for plants by name using the search bar, which filters the displayed list of plants.

### Advanced Features

1. **Update Plant Price**: Users can update the price of any plant directly from the plant card. The updated price is persisted to the backend.
2. **Delete a Plant**: Users can delete a plant from the inventory, and it will be removed from the list and the backend.

## Usage

### Add a Plant

To add a plant, fill in the "Plant Name", "Image URL", and "Price" in the form at the top of the page, then click **Add Plant**. The new plant will be added to the list.

### Search for Plants

Use the search bar to filter plants by typing part of their name. The plant list updates dynamically as you type.

### Update Plant Price

In the plant card, type a new price into the price input field, then click **Update Price** to save the updated price. This change will persist in the backend.

### Mark a Plant as Sold Out

Each plant card has an **In Stock** button. Clicking it toggles the plant between "In Stock" and "Out of Stock".

### Delete a Plant

Click the **Delete** button in the plant card to remove a plant from the inventory.
